The purpose of eglib is to be a small MIT licensed subset of glib.

The implementation is done from the public documentation available here:

    http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/

Currently all the definitions go into a single file: glib.h, there are 
no separate files, please try to follow the convetions in the source code

* Tests
	
	Please read the README in tests/

* Features

	The source code is designed to allow for different operating
	system builds of the eglib code.

	Files in src that:

	  * Have a plain name: are cross platform, and should work on
	    every operating system.

	  * That end in -unix.c: These files contain Unix specific code.

	  * That end in -win32.c: These files contain Win32 specific code.

	  * That end in -posix.c: Will work on both Windows and Unix,
            but should not be included for other operating systems.
